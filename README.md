# Pong

Classic Pong game, written in Lua and built with LÖVE.

## About this project

Pong is an open-source game written in Lua utilizing the game framework [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). It is the first game I have written with LÖVE.

## Running the game

Download or clone this repo, and then run the project with LÖVE, which can be downloaded [here](https://love2d.org/). The game will only work properly with versions 11.4 or later. The easiest way to run a project with LÖVE is to drag the project folder onto a LÖVE application shortcut.
